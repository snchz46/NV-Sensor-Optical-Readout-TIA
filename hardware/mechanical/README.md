# Optical Alignment Notes

The mechanical fixtures in this directory focus on aligning the LED excitation source, NV-diamond sample, and BPW34 photodiode so that fluorescence changes translate into reliable photocurrent.

## Alignment Strategy
- **LED Mount:** Collimated green LED source mounted on a threaded holder for focus adjustment.
- **Diamond Seat:** 3D-printed saddle that locks the NV-diamond at the beam waist while keeping optical epoxy clear of the sensor area.
- **Photodiode Bracket:** Adjustable arm that places the BPW34 at 90° to the excitation path to minimise stray reflections.

## Magnetic Field Integration
- Threaded rod guides a neodymium magnet to vary the local magnetic field strength.
- Scale markings along the rod translate position to approximate magnetic flux density.
